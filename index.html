    <h2 class="special">The Show</h2>
    <p>BIRD SHOW documents the ways humans & birds notice, help, and threaten each other.</p>
    <p>Taxonified incorrectly as science fair, fairly as art gallery, but most specifically as museum exhibition, BIRD SHOW looks at humans watching birds, and the birds staring back.</p>

    <h2 class="special">The City Reliquary</h2>
    <p>Reliquaries typically hold the ostensible bones of dead saints. We hold the bones of Old New York.</p>
    <p>We’ve been collecting them since 2002, when we started in an apartment window at Grand & Havemeyer.</p>
    <p>In 2005 we moved to our present storefront home on Metropolitan Avenue, with beloved yellow awning painted by <a href="https://firstandfifteenth.net/">I.C.Y.</a>.</p>
    <p>We had <a href="https://celebrate.cityreliquary.org">an interesting 2021</a>.</p>
    <p>Become <a class="special" href="https://cityreliquary.org/join">an esteemed Reliquary member</a> to make this community micro-institution last.</p>
